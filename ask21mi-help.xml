    === General Help ===
    
     - You can take off using your engine,a winch or another aircraft as an aerotow.
     - The winch / aerotow cable can be released with the "o" key or using button 1 of the (first) joystick.
     - NOTE: The Walker uses r/R and f/F for walking instead of w and s.
     
     === Powered Takeoff Procedure ===
     - Fully extend speed brake so that wheel brake comes in
     - Set trim just forward of the middle position.
     - Switch on battery if not already done ("Ctrl-b")
     - Switch on the Engine Electric Master or press "Ctrl-e"
     - Extend your propeller (Switch on ILEC or "e")
     - Check that the propeller area is clear
     - Switch on the Ignition Switch (Switch on ILEC or "}")
     - Release the propeller brake
     - Press the starter switch or "s"
     - Wait until engine catches
     - Advance your throttle fully forward and retract and lock the speedbrakes
     - Level the glider and keep it level using your aileron
     - Stay on centerline using your rudder
     - Take off when the glider has enough speed to lift on its own, dont pull it up much.
     - Maintain the best climb speed (blue line on the ASI)
     
    === Winch Takeoff Procedure ===

     - Retract speed brake
     - Set trim just forward of the middle position.
     - Press 'Ctrl-w' to place winch.
     - Press 'Shift-w' to start winch and take up cable slack.
     - When the glider starts moving, press 'Shift-w' several times to accelerate the winch
       (up to full speed).
     - Keep the wings level with the aileron and the glider going in a straight line with the rudder.
       Keep elevator centered, the glider will lift off and rotate by automatically as long as the trim is set
       correctly.
       Once the established in the climb, you can pull back on the stick slightly to increase climb rate.
     - Control the winch speed throughout the entire launch. 'Shift-w' makes the winch run faster,
       'w' makes it run slower.
       Try to maintain constant force on the cable, you will need to gradually slow down the winch
       as glider climbs.
     - When the glider reaches the top of the launch, close winch throttle to 5% and press 'o'
       to release the cable.

    === Aerotow Takeoff Procedure ===

      - Retract speed brake
      - Place another aerotow aircraft in front of your glider (multi-player).
      - Press 'Ctrl-o' to hook to the aerotow.
      - Ask the other aircraft to take off :).
      - Keep wings level and follow the aircraft until after takeoff.
      - The glider should lift off before the tug, stay close to the ground until the tug starts climbing.
      - When at appropriate alitude, press 'o' to release the cable.

    === Ground handling===

    This aircraft has some features to help with ground handling:

      - Enable wing holder: the aircraft gets levelled around the x-axis as if
        someone was holding your wing.
      - Enable ground handling: controls are modified to help move the glider around
        on the ground:
        1. All rudder inputs will make the glider turn, as if someone was pulling on the wingtip.
        2. All speedbrake inputs cause the glider to taxi, as if someone (or a car) was pulling or pushing it.
      - When exceeding a given speed of 15 kts assisting gears will be reset to off (e.g. on takeoff), ground handling will become inactive at 20kts.

    When there is somebody with a follow-me around, you can connect to it by pressing Ctrl+o
    (release: Ctrl+shift+o) so he can carry you around the airport
    or even tow you into the air! (also check the Aerotow Settings therefore).
